you can write your algorithms and compare the benchmarks between yours and the native algorithms.

## operations
### gestures 
* single finger **`swipe left`**, move the line window to previous dates. the more distance causes the more previous dates.
* single finger **`swipe right`**, move the line window to next dates. the more distance causes the more next dates.
* two fingers **`swipe up`**, zoom in the window, the less dates showed in the window.
* two fingers **`swipe down`**, zoom out the window, the more dates showed in the window.

## shortcuts
### k line view
* **`space`**, highlight one chart of polylines outputed by your aglorithm program. repeat this shortcut key, the next polyline would be chosen.
* **`clt + space`**, highlight one chart of polylines outputed by your aglorithm program, and hide the others.
* **`clt + B`**, show the render's benchmarks and statistics info. repeat this shortcut key, the next render policy would be chosen.

### aglorithm editor
* **`clt + Q`**, test the program via the default compiler.
* **`alt + Q`**，test the program via an another advanced compiler. this feature needs you download the `resource2-2.pkg`.
* **`clt + S`**，save current modified program copy, and the `K Line View` could reload results from your new program.
* **`clt + F`**, search the word selection around the current program copy, and highlight all the matches.
* **`F3`**, jump to next matching word searched by **`clt + F`**.
* **`clt + F3`**, jump to previous matching word searched by **`clt + F`**.

## programming
### functions
* **`CLOSE()`**, get the sequence of the close prices.
* **`OPEN()`**, get the sequence of the open prices.
* **`HIGH()`**, get the sequence of the high prices.
* **`LOW()`**, get the sequence of the low prices.
* **`VOL()`**, get the sequence of the Volume.
* **`DATE()`**, get the sequence of the listed dates.
* **`MA(S, N)`**, a native implement of MA algorithm.
* **`SMA(S, N, M)`**, a native implement of SMA algorithm.

### classes
* **`AlgoK`**
* **`AlgoK::Bench`**, help you to benchmark your algorithms, outputs on the `dbgview` tool.

## openmp
OpenMP 4.5 supported.

## simd
SSE3 `tmmintrin.h` supported.
